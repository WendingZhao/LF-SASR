## LF-DAnet: Learning a Degradation-Adaptive Network for Light Field Image Super-Resolution
<br>

This is the PyTorch implementation of the method in our paper "Learning a Degradation-Adaptive Network for Light Field Image Super-Resolution".<br>

## News and Updates:
* 2022-05-25: Repository is created.


## Demo Videos:
We show the SR results of our LF-DAnet on real LFs captured by Lytro Illum cameras. More examples are available [here](https://github.com/YingqianWang/LF-DAnet/blob/main/demo_videos.md). Note that, these videos have been compressed, and the results shown below are inferior to the original outputs of our LF-DAnet.

## Visual Comparisons to SOTA:

Please view [this video](https://wyqdatabase.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/LF-DAnet_compare.mp4) for a visual comparison with existing state-of-the-art SR methods.

## Adjustable input degradations:

We develop an [online demo](https://zhengyuliang24.github.io/LF-DAnet-Page/) to show the real-world SR performance with respect to input degradations. You can adjust the kernel width and noise level by dragging the sliding blocks to understand their influence to the SR results.
