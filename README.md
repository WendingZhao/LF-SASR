## LF-DAnet: Learning a Degradation-Adaptive Network for Light Field Image Super-Resolution
<br>

This is the PyTorch implementation of the method in our paper "Learning a Degradation-Adaptive Network for Light Field Image Super-Resolution".<br>

## News and Updates:
* 2022-05-25: Repository is created.


## Video Demos:
We show the results produced by our LF-DAnet on real-world LFs (captured by Lytro Illum cameras). Note that, these videos have been compressed, and the results shown below are inferior to the actual outputs of our LF-DAnet.
