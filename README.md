## LF-SASR

LF-SASR(Light Field Scenario-Aware Super Resolution) aims to bridge the gap between idealized synthetic datasets and challenging real-world environments, providing practical and efficient solutions for light field super-resolution tasks. Building upon the foundation of LF-DMNet, this project advances light field image super-resolution for real-world scenarios by introducing dual-case degradation modeling and a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture, as following.

This project is forked from [LF-DMnet](https://github.com/yingqianwang/LF-DMnet) and is partly based on [EPIT](https://github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/EPIT/).

## Quantitative Results

We show the quantitative results for comparison.

## Preparation:

#### 1. Requirement:

* PyTorch 2.5.0, torchvision 0.20.0. The code is tested with python=3.12.7, cuda=12.7 (with a gpu of vGPU32GB from autodl).
* Matlab or Python for training/validation/test data generation.
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for environment configuration.

#### 2. Datasets:

* We use the HCInew, HCIold and STFgantry datasets for training and test.
* We use the EPFL, INRIA and STFlytro datasets (which are developed by using Lytro cameras) to test the practical value of our method.

#### 3. Training/test data Generation:

* Run `GenerateDataForTraining.m`  or  ` Generate_Data_for_SSR_Training.py`   to generate training data. 
* The test data can be generated by modifying the above code.

## Train/Test:

* We provide two deployment methods, which are respectively deployed on the RGB three-channel and the Y single-channel.
* Run `train.py` or  `train_epit.py` to perform network training. 
* Run `test_real.py` or  `test_epit.py` to perform network test. 
* Run `test.py` to perform SR on your own LFs.
