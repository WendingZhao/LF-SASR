## LF-DAnet: Learning a Degradation-Adaptive Network for Light Field Image Super-Resolution
<br>

This is the PyTorch implementation of the method in our paper "Learning a Degradation-Adaptive Network for Light Field Image Super-Resolution".<br>

## News and Updates:
* 2022-05-25: Repository is created.


## Demo Videos:
We show the SR results of our LF-DAnet on real LFs captured by Lytro Illum cameras. More examples are available [here](https://github.com/YingqianWang/LF-DAnet/blob/main/demo_videos.md). Note that, these videos have been compressed, and the results shown below are inferior to the original outputs of our LF-DAnet.
